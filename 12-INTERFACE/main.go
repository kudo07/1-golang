	// lin kin
	// .view different structs in the same way
	// emplpoyee and person may be have different methods and work in the different manner
	// viewing as the same type of object which is "Name" and allow me to accces any of the methods inside the "Name " interface
	// if i implement or define the different methods in interface then we have to define the methods as in the struct of employee adn person
	// but that is not mean that these structs not have their specif methods
